# BountyBlocks (Non-code resources and documentation)
## Project Overview
BountyBlocks began as an on-chain bug bounty platform and has evolved into a web3 Verifiable Bounty Ledger (VBL).

We strengthen transparency and community. With BountyBlocks:

Sponsors prevent vulnerabilities from disrupting their products.
Ethical hackers remediate issues for monetary rewards (e.g., USDF bounties) and reputational rewards (NFT credentials)â€”staying pseudonymous while proving capability.
Our solution is token-agnostic: sponsors fund in one asset; hackers claim in another via on-chain swaps. The VBL automates quotes, routing, and slippage, and records assets, rates, and proofs for audit.

Built on Flow for programmable issue management and atomic payouts, and Walrus for privacy-preserving evidence and selective disclosure, BountyBlocks delivers an end-to-end, transparent, auditable bounty workflow.

## This repo:
This repo is used to store non-code files (such as images, diagrams, slides, etc.) used in our development of BountyBlocks at ETHGlobal NYC. It is intended to show the thought process that went into development and hold things like the pitch deck that don't fit in well in the code repos.
